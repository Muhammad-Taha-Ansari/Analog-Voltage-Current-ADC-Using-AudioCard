# Analog-Voltage-Current-ADC-Using-AudioCard
This project converts analog voltage and current signals into digital form using an audio card as an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The system captures real-world analog data, processes it through MATLAB, and analyzes waveform characteristics in real-time.
